# MuWire - Easy Anonymous File-Sharing

MuWire is an easy to use file-sharing program which offers anonymity using [I2P technology](http://geti2p.net).

It is inspired by the LimeWire Gnutella client and developped by a former LimeWire developer.

The project is in early planning stage.  You can find technical documentation in the "doc" folder.
