# MuWire Design

### Initial Bootstrap

Initial bootstrap into the MuWire network is done in a similar fashion to Gnutella.  Dedicated bootstrap servers ("HostCaches") listen for incoming I2P Datagrams which contain requests for addresses of ultrapeers.  The incoming datagram has a flag whether the requesting node is an ultrapeer or a leaf; if the node claims to be an ultrapeer it may be added to the list of known ultrapeers by the HostCache.  Implementors of HostCaches are free to choose other discovery strategies such as crawling, active polling and so on.

In response to the request, the HostCache sends back an I2P datagram containing b64 destinations of selected ultrapeers.  The requesting client can then choose to close the I2P tunnel that it used to send the request because it will now know about ultrapeers to connect to.
